2. The server is configured to serve the static build from `/client/build`.

## Testing

- **Automated API tests**: The backend API endpoints are covered by automated tests using Jest and Supertest. See `server/tests/races.test.js` for examples.
- To run tests, use:
  ```sh
  cd server
  npm test
  ```
- Tests ensure that the main endpoints (e.g., `/api/races`, `/api/races/:id/results`) return correct data and status codes.
